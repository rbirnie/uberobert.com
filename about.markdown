<p>
Hi, I’m Robert Birnie — a technology leader, systems engineer, and lifelong tinkerer. Over the past two decades, I’ve worked across startups, scale-ups, and global enterprises, building and operating infrastructure that powers millions of users worldwide. 
</p>

<p>
Most recently, I’ve been consulting on CloudOPS and compliance (SOC2). Before that, I served as Vice President of Global Operations at <a href="http://www.threatmetrix.com">ThreatMetrix</a> (acquired by LexisNexis Risk Solutions), where I led global IT, infrastructure, and DevOps — supporting billions of monthly transaction fraud prevention system. I’ve also held roles at <a href="http://us.etrade.com">E*TRADE Financial</a>, <a href="http://www.cardiodx.com">CardioDx</a>, and other technology companies.
</p>

<p>
At my core, I love solving hard problems with automation. My ideal future is one where systems are so self-managing that nobody ever needs to SSH into a Linux box again. Until then, I’ll happily keep writing scripts, building dashboards, and streamlining operations wherever I can.
</p>

<p>
Outside of work, I’m a bookworm, traveler, scuba diver, and sailor. I just returned from a four-year sabbatical to explore the Pacific with my family aboard our Maple Leaf 48’ sailboat. I’m also an aquarist, gardener, runner, anime watcher, foodie, husband, and father. If only there were more hours in the day…
